The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `false`.
	TraceEnabled **bool `json:"traceEnabled,omitempty"`
	// Enable or disable generation of send spans. For the most complete view of broker message processing, this should be enabled. If the information provided by send spans are not needed, send spans can be disabled to reduce the performance impact of tracing.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"vpn/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\".
