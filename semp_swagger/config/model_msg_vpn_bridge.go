The allowed values and their meaning are:  <pre> \"primary\" - The Bridge is used for the primary virtual router. \"backup\" - The Bridge is used for the backup virtual router. \"auto\" - The Bridge is automatically assigned a virtual router at creation, depending on the broker's active-standby role. </pre>

The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\". Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `8`.

	MsgVpnName string `json:"msgVpnName,omitempty"`
	// The Client Username the Bridge uses to login to the remote Message VPN.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"vpn/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\". Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `\"\"`.
	RemoteAuthenticationBasicClientUsername string `json:"remoteAuthenticationBasicClientUsername,omitempty"`
	// The password for the Client Username.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"vpn/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\". This attribute is absent from a GET and not updated when absent in a PUT, subject to the exceptions [here](https://docs.solace.com/Admin/SEMP/SEMP-API-Archit.htm#HTTP_Methods). Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `\"\"`.
	RemoteAuthenticationBasicPassword string `json:"remoteAuthenticationBasicPassword,omitempty"`
	// The PEM formatted content for the client certificate used by the Bridge to login to the remote Message VPN. It must consist of a private key and between one and three certificates comprising the certificate trust chain.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"vpn/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\". This attribute is absent from a GET and not updated when absent in a PUT, subject to the exceptions [here](https://docs.solace.com/Admin/SEMP/SEMP-API-Archit.htm#HTTP_Methods). Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change.

	// The authentication scheme for the remote Message VPN.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"vpn/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\". Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `\"basic\"`. The allowed values and their meaning are:  <pre> \"basic\" - Basic Authentication Scheme (via username and password). \"client-certificate\" - Client Certificate Authentication Scheme (via certificate file or content). \"tls-psk\" - This authentication scheme is used internally by the broker. It cannot be directly configured by a user. </pre> 
	RemoteAuthenticationScheme string `json:"remoteAuthenticationScheme,omitempty"`
	// The number of retry attempts to establish a connection before moving on to the next remote Message VPN.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"vpn/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `0`.

Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `\"p1\"`. The allowed values and their meaning are:  <pre> \"p1\" - The 1st or highest priority. \"p2\" - The 2nd highest priority. \"p3\" - The 3rd highest priority. \"p4\" - The 4th highest priority. \"da\" - Ignore priority and deliver always. </pre> 
	RemoteDeliverToOnePriority string `json:"remoteDeliverToOnePriority,omitempty"`
	// The colon-separated list of cipher suites supported for TLS connections to the remote Message VPN when using TLS 1.2 and lower. The value \"default\" implies all supported suites ordered from most secure to least secure.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"vpn/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync.
