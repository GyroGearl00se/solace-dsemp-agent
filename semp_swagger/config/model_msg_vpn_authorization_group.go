Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `\"default\"`.

	// The name of the Authorization Group. For LDAP groups, special care is needed if the group name contains special characters such as '#', '+', ';', '=' as the value of the group name returned from the LDAP server might prepend those characters with '\\'. For example a group name called 'test#,lab,com' will be returned from the LDAP server as 'test\\#,lab,com'.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"vpn/read-only\".
	AuthorizationGroupName string `json:"authorizationGroupName,omitempty"`
	// The Client Profile of the Authorization Group.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"vpn/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\". Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `\"default\"`.
	ClientProfileName string `json:"clientProfileName,omitempty"`

The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `false`.

	// Lower the priority to be less than this group.  The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\". This attribute is absent from a GET and not updated when absent in a PUT, subject to the exceptions [here](https://docs.solace.com/Admin/SEMP/SEMP-API-Archit.htm#HTTP_Methods). Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default is not applicable.
	OrderAfterAuthorizationGroupName string `json:"orderAfterAuthorizationGroupName,omitempty"`
	// Raise the priority to be greater than this group.  The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\". This attribute is absent from a GET and not updated when absent in a PUT, subject to the exceptions [here](https://docs.solace.com/Admin/SEMP/SEMP-API-Archit.htm#HTTP_Methods).
