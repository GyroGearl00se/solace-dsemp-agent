The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/mesh-manager\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `true`.
	AuthenticationBasicEnabled **bool `json:"authenticationBasicEnabled,omitempty"`
	// The password used to authenticate incoming Cluster Links when using basic internal authentication. The same password is also used by outgoing Cluster Links if a per-Link password is not configured.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/mesh-manager\". This attribute is absent from a GET and not updated when absent in a PUT, subject to the exceptions [here](https://docs.solace.com/Admin/SEMP/SEMP-API-Archit.htm#HTTP_Methods). Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `\"\"`.
	AuthenticationBasicPassword string `json:"authenticationBasicPassword,omitempty"`
	// The type of basic authentication to use for Cluster Links.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/mesh-manager\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `\"internal\"`. The allowed values and their meaning are:  <pre> \"internal\" - Use locally configured password. \"none\" - No authentication. </pre> 
	AuthenticationBasicType string `json:"authenticationBasicType,omitempty"`
	// The PEM formatted content for the client certificate used to login to the remote node. It must consist of a private key and between one and three certificates comprising the certificate trust chain.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/mesh-manager\". This attribute is absent from a GET and not updated when absent in a PUT, subject to the exceptions [here](https://docs.solace.com/Admin/SEMP/SEMP-API-Archit.htm#HTTP_Methods). Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change.

	// Enable or disable client certificate authentication for Cluster Links.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/mesh-manager\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `true`.
	AuthenticationClientCertEnabled **bool `json:"authenticationClientCertEnabled,omitempty"`
	// The password for the client certificate.  The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/mesh-manager\". This attribute is absent from a GET and not updated when absent in a PUT, subject to the exceptions [here](https://docs.solace.com/Admin/SEMP/SEMP-API-Archit.htm#HTTP_Methods).

The default value is `\"\"`.
	AuthenticationClientCertPassword string `json:"authenticationClientCertPassword,omitempty"`
	// Enable or disable direct messaging only. Guaranteed messages will not be transmitted through the cluster.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The default value is `false`.
	DirectOnlyEnabled **bool `json:"directOnlyEnabled,omitempty"`
	// The name of the Cluster.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\".
	DmrClusterName string `json:"dmrClusterName,omitempty"`
	// Enable or disable the Cluster.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/mesh-manager\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `false`.
	Enabled **bool `json:"enabled,omitempty"`
	// The name of this node in the Cluster. This is the name that this broker (or redundant group of brokers) is know by to other nodes in the Cluster. The name is chosen automatically to be either this broker's Router Name or Mate Router Name, depending on which Active Standby Role (primary or backup) this broker plays in its redundancy group.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\".
	NodeName string `json:"nodeName,omitempty"`
	// Enable or disable the enforcing of the common name provided by the remote broker against the list of trusted common names configured for the Link. If enabled, the certificate's common name must match one of the trusted common names for the Link to be accepted. Common Name validation is not performed if Server Certificate Name Validation is enabled, even if Common Name validation is enabled.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/mesh-manager\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `false`. Deprecated since 2.18. Common Name validation has been replaced by Server Certificate Name validation.
	TlsServerCertEnforceTrustedCommonNameEnabled **bool `json:"tlsServerCertEnforceTrustedCommonNameEnabled,omitempty"`
	// The maximum allowed depth of a certificate chain. The depth of a chain is defined as the number of signing CA certificates that are present in the chain back to a trusted self-signed root CA certificate.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/mesh-manager\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `3`.
	TlsServerCertMaxChainDepth int64 `json:"tlsServerCertMaxChainDepth,omitempty"`
	// Enable or disable the validation of the \"Not Before\" and \"Not After\" validity dates in the certificate. When disabled, the certificate is accepted even if the certificate is not valid based on these dates.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/mesh-manager\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `true`.
	TlsServerCertValidateDateEnabled **bool `json:"tlsServerCertValidateDateEnabled,omitempty"`
	// Enable or disable the standard TLS authentication mechanism of verifying the name used to connect to the bridge. If enabled, the name used to connect to the bridge is checked against the names specified in the certificate returned by the remote broker. Legacy Common Name validation is not performed if Server Certificate Name Validation is enabled, even if Common Name validation is also enabled.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/mesh-manager\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `true`. Available since 2.18.
