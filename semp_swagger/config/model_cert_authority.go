type CertAuthority struct {
	// The name of the Certificate Authority.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". Deprecated since 2.19. Replaced by clientCertAuthorities and domainCertAuthorities.
	CertAuthorityName string `json:"certAuthorityName,omitempty"`
	// The PEM formatted content for the trusted root certificate of a Certificate Authority.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/admin\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `\"\"`. Deprecated since 2.19. certAuthorities replaced by clientCertAuthorities and domainCertAuthorities.
	CertContent string `json:"certContent,omitempty"`
	// The scheduled CRL refresh day(s), specified as \"daily\" or a comma-separated list of days. Days must be specified as \"Sun\", \"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", or \"Sat\", with no spaces, and in sorted order from Sunday to Saturday.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/admin\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `\"daily\"`. Deprecated since 2.19. certAuthorities replaced by clientCertAuthorities and domainCertAuthorities.
	CrlDayList string `json:"crlDayList,omitempty"`
	// The scheduled CRL refresh time(s), specified as \"hourly\" or a comma-separated list of 24-hour times in the form hh:mm, or h:mm. There must be no spaces, and times must be in sorted order from 0:00 to 23:59.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/admin\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `\"3:00\"`. Deprecated since 2.19. certAuthorities replaced by clientCertAuthorities and domainCertAuthorities.
	CrlTimeList string `json:"crlTimeList,omitempty"`

The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/admin\". Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as revocationCheckEnabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `\"\"`. Deprecated since 2.19. certAuthorities replaced by clientCertAuthorities and domainCertAuthorities.
	CrlUrl string `json:"crlUrl,omitempty"`
	// Enable or disable allowing a non-responder certificate to sign an OCSP response. Typically used with an OCSP override URL in cases where a single certificate is used to sign client certificates and OCSP responses.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"global/admin\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `false`. Deprecated since 2.19. certAuthorities replaced by clientCertAuthorities and domainCertAuthorities.

Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates via config-sync. The default value is `5`. Deprecated since 2.19. certAuthorities replaced by clientCertAuthorities and domainCertAuthorities.
	OcspTimeout int64 `json:"ocspTimeout,omitempty"`
	// Enable or disable Certificate Authority revocation checking.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"global/read-only\".
