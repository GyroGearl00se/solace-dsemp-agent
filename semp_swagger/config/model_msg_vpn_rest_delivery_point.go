Its queue properties are used by the RDP client. The Client Profile is used inside the auto-generated Client Username for this RDP.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"vpn/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\". Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `\"default\"`.
	ClientProfileName string `json:"clientProfileName,omitempty"`
	// Enable or disable the REST Delivery Point. When disabled, no connections are initiated or messages delivered to any of the contained REST Consumers.  The minimum access scope/level required to retrieve this attribute is \"vpn/read-only\". The minimum access scope/level required to change this attribute is \"vpn/read-write\". Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `false`.
